                    <h2>A. Choose a YouTube content category based on skill and technical requirements</h2><br>
                    <p1>We evaluated 3 categories; these are Motivational videos, Commentary style videos, and Music videos</p1>

                    <p1></p1>
               Motivational videos give a sense of concern while also being professional. Watching motivational videos lifts up the mood and makes you feel motivated to take action.
<br><br>
Commentary has a more ‘laid back’ style, although less professional it gives the perspective of a real person. Typically, they analyze the topic, explain it to the audience (giving them background, the current status, and their views/opinions about this)
<br><br>
Music videos or song video is a short film integrating a song and imagery, produced for a promotional and artistic purposes. They’re usually paired with a choreography or a depiction of a story. There is a vast majority of music videos be it serious or unprofessional; the main idea of music videos is to entertain its listeners and to tell a message.

                    <p1>Motivational Videos - We chose motivational videos because it gives a sense of inspiration, it boosts thier confidence, and encourages those who watch to try to contribute and do their part.
